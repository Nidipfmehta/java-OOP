PartA:
A TreeSet stores elements in sorted order
A Set does not allow for duplicate values

PartB:
                Checkpoint A Checkpoint B Checkpoint C Checkpoint D Checkpoint E
list.isEmpty()      S           N               N           S           S

result.isEmpty()    A           A               S           N           S

PartC:
Uses a for-each loop to look at each key from m to sum the numbers in the inner
sets, adding the key to a set if the sum equals the associated key
